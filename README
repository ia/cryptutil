		cryptutil
	encryption utility for human beings

/!\ Warning! This is very unstable software, that can harm your data.
Before any encryption actions with data you should backup that data.

cryptutil is a small utility based on:
 • EcryptFS stack
 • Parted library
 • Cryptsetup tool
for encryption and handling encrypted data in an easy way.

0. Rationale

There are a lot tools, which can encrypt data.
But most popular of them for GNU/Linux:
• EcryptFS for directories
• Cryptsetup for partitions/disks (via LUKS - Linux Unified Key Setup)
But for handle encrypted data, these tools and their commands too dissimilar.
cryptutil is just command-line front-end for handle encryption with simple
actions, commands and options.

====

1. Installation

cryptutil can be installed from package, or from sources.
Packages for Ubuntu can be found in this launchpad repository:
http://launchpad.net/~iaz/+archive/cryptutil
Debian/Ubuntu-related source code tree (with debian/ directory for packaging):
http://code.launchpad.net/~iaz/cryptutil/trunk
non-Debian/Ubuntu source code tree (without debian/ directory):
http://github.com/ia/cryptutil
Command for installation from sources:
$ ./configure && make
# make install

====

2. Basic Usage

Currently cryptutil support only basic operations, and only for directories
via EcryptFS. For encrypt directory run in terminal:
# cryptutil encrypt /path/to/directory
You must be type password for encrypt your directory.

/!\ WARNING! Password will be asked only one time without any prompt!

And then just hit enter on FNEK question. Done! Your data is encrypted
and directory is mounted and available for access.
For unmount("unencrypt") directory:
# umount /path/to/directory

For decrypt directory:
# cryptutil decrypt /path/to/directory

You must be type password for decrypt your directory.
And then just hit enter on FNEK question. Done! Your data is decrypted
and directory is mounted again and available for access.
If password is wrong, you can't get access to your directory.

3. Technical Details

cryptutil written in C with using:
• exec calls for handling ecryptfs stack via mount
• libparted for probe block devices and handle it for encryption*
• cryptsetup/libcryptsetup for encrypt/decrypt block devices via LUKS*

* - not implemented; work in progress.

/!\ Note
For using EcryptFS Linux kernel must have support EcryptFS module.
For using LUKS Linux kernel must have support dm-crypt module.
